# Shirewear
## A Hugo theme inspired by Hobbit fashion

**Shirewear** is a warm, earthy, and elegant blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), inspired by the clothing stlye, fashion & general coziness described in J.R.R. Tolkiens novels.

With a palette of soft browns, muted greens, and warm yellows, Shirewear provides a comforting reading experience, just before the second breakfast.
